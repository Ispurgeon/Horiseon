Completing the model 1 challenge and making sure it meets all of the required criteria.
I encountered many road blocks on this assignment, but thanks to my grading team, I have greatly improved and learned how to properly clone, connect, and complete the desired files and work.
I encountered this mistake below when fixing the starter code in order to meet proper criteria and added the proper ID in order for the link to function.

I will use the knowledge for future assignments and reflect on my work.
